Coding tasks related to Data Types and Conditional Statements, Iteration, Programming with User-defined Functions, Handling Strings, Lists and Dictionaries, File IO Operations, and OOP - Classes

1. This Python code creates a file named alternative.py and implements a program that reads in a string. It alternates the case of each character in the first part and alternates the case of each word in the second part using the split() and join() functions. The program then prints the results for both cases.
[alternative.py](https://github.com/lsls0505/codingTasks/blob/main/alternative.py)

2. This Python code creates a file named award.py and prompts the user to input times for swimming, cycling, and running. It calculates the total time and determines the award based on the specified criteria, displaying the total time and the corresponding award.
[award.py](https://github.com/lsls0505/codingTasks/blob/main/award.py)

3. This Python code creates a file named cafe.py and implements a program for a cafe. It defines a menu list, stock dictionary, and price dictionary. The program calculates the total stock worth in the cafe by looping through the menu list and accessing corresponding values in the stock and price dictionaries. Finally, it prints out the result of the calculation.
[cafe.py](https://github.com/lsls0505/codingTasks/blob/main/cafe.py)

4. This Python code follows the provided steps, creating a new file named conversion.py, declaring variables, converting them according to the specified instructions, and then printing the converted variables on separate lines.
[conversion.py](https://github.com/lsls0505/codingTasks/blob/main/conversion.py)

5. This Python code creates a new file named details.py and uses the input() function to gather the user's name, age, house number, and street name. It then prints out a single sentence combining all the user details as specified in the provided pseudo code.
[details.py](https://github.com/lsls0505/codingTasks/blob/main/details.py)

6. This Python code creates a file named dob_task.py and reads data from the provided text file (DOB.txt). It then separates names and birthdates into two lists and prints them out in two different sections as specified in the task. The file path should be adjusted to the actual location of the DOB.txt file.
[dob_task.py](https://github.com/lsls0505/codingTasks/blob/main/dob_task.py)

7. This Python code uses the input() function to take in the user's name and age. It then prints out the name, age, and the string "Hello World!" on separate lines as described in the provided pseudo code.
[hello_world.py](https://github.com/lsls0505/codingTasks/blob/main/hello_world.py)

8. This Python code creates a file named holiday.py and implements a program to calculate a user's total holiday cost based on inputs for the city_flight, num_nights, and rental_days. It defines functions for calculating individual costs (hotel, plane, and car rental) and a function to calculate the total holiday cost. The program then prints out all the details about the holiday in a readable format.
[holiday.py](https://github.com/lsls0505/codingTasks/blob/main/holiday.py)

9. This Python code creates a file named manipulation.py, prompts the user to enter a sentence, performs various manipulations on the input string according to the specified instructions, and prints the results.
[manipulation.py](https://github.com/lsls0505/codingTasks/blob/main/manipulation.py)

10. This Python code creates a file named numbers.py, prompts the user to enter three different integers, and performs various calculations on these numbers as per the provided instructions, printing the results. The code also includes a check to avoid division by zero if the third number is zero.
[numbers.py](https://github.com/lsls0505/codingTasks/blob/main/numbers.py)

11. This Python code creates a file named pattern.py and uses a single for loop along with if-else statements to output the specified pattern. It ensures that the pattern is printed as described in the task.
[pattern.py](https://github.com/lsls0505/codingTasks/blob/main/pattern.py)

12. This Python code creates a file named student_register.py and implements a program to register students for an exam venue. It asks the user how many students are registering, runs a for loop to gather student ID numbers, and writes each ID to a text file (reg_form.txt) with a dotted line after each ID.
[student_register.py](https://github.com/lsls0505/codingTasks/blob/main/student_register.py)

13. This Python code creates a file named while.py and implements a program using a while loop to continually ask the user to enter numbers. It stops when the user enters "-1", calculates the average of the entered numbers (excluding "-1"), and displays the result.
[while.py](https://github.com/lsls0505/codingTasks/blob/main/while.py)
